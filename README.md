# Hide and Seek

Hide and seek is a game about hiding and seeking with your favorite characters!

## Premise
It’s a nice winter day in funtime land, and nice weather only leads to one thing, Hide and Seek! You and some of your favorite friends (characters from your favorite movies, games and media), all come together to play their favorite game, that being Hide and Seek! 


## Mechanics
Your task is to find all of your friends who’ve gone and hid throughout the funtime land courtyard. Examine objects in the environment to find your buddies! Statues, barrels, trees, oh my! Your friends could be anywhere, so go out and do your best!

## Aesthetics
A mixed media game with all of your favorite characters. Pixel sprites, with character dialogue portraites.

### Dev's feelings
Joys - This project was a great time from top to bottom. The fun of the project came as we regularly would stop and ask eachother questions like “you know who else we should add to our game?” The vibe we had when putting the game together was immaculate.
