# Hide and Seek

Hide and seek is a game about playing hide and seek with your favorite characters!

## Premise
It’s a nice winter day in funtime land, and nice weather only leads to one thing, Hide and Seek! You and some of your favorite friends (characters from your favorite movies, games and media), all come together to play their favorite game, that being Hide and Seek! 


## Mechanics
Your task is to find all of your friends who’ve gone and hid throughout the funtime land courtyard. Examine objects in the environment to find your buddies! Statues, barrels, trees, oh my! Your friends could be anywhere, so go out and do your best!

## Aesthetics
A mixed media game with all of your favorite characters. Pixel sprites, with character dialogue portraites.

### Dev's feelings
Joys - This project was a great time from top to bottom. The fun of the project came as we regularly would stop and ask eachother questions like “you know who else we should add to our game?” The vibe we had when putting the game together was immaculate.

Struggles - tilemaps are not great for decoratives! I spent a majority of the time trying to figure out how to make the game look aesthetically pleasing using the tilemap grids and it was a real hell. that said, the menu looks fantastic.

##### Dev credits
Jauss - Assembled both scenes, scripted the characters' hiding behavior, scripted the UI and the portraits popping up, wrote some of the character dialogue. I also animated the fire in the walls in the menu screen by hand using an asset from the tilemap we borrowed.

Jory - Contributed a portion of the characters we used in our game, along with gathering assets for, and writing dialogue for said character portions. Created character sprites for player, and other NPC characters.
